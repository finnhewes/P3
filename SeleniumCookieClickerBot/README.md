This is a self-guided project from the 100 Days of Python Udemy course, but I've gone a little overboard, and have tried a number of different techniques/algorithms in an attempt to get the highest cookies/second score possible.
What suggestions would you make to improve these algorithms and bump up my C/S score??? Let me know!
