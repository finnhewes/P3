This is a self-guided project from the 100 Days of Python Udemy course.
I have tried a number of different techniques/algorithms in an attempt to get the highest cookies/second score possible.
These are pretty much tweaks on the same base-layer algorithim... Doing things like tweaking intervals, etc.
What suggestions would you make to improve these algorithms and bump up my C/S score??? Let me know!
