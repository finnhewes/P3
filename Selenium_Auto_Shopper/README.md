This is an automated shopping bot! 

Since I'm living in Turkey at the moment, but all of my bank accounts and credit cards are US-based, I'm constantly checking the exchange rate before and doing lots of math in my head before making any purchases. 

Relevant side note about myself: I'm also into filmmaking and YouTube, but I sold all of my gear before moving overseas! Naturally I'm in the market for new light kit.

Companies configure lighting kits for sale in a million different ways, and the pricing is pretty all over the place. However, it's a bit like playing with legos... or programming... or building anything yourself really! You can mix and match, and arrive at whatever your desired functionality is. 

I know what I want in my kit. I'm looking for a lighting kit with a boom arm, so I can stick a light panel up overhead, and get better lighting on my easel when I'm making drawing/paitning videos for my YouTube page, or just to hold a microphone or overhead  camera angle... now that I think about it, the uses for a boom arm are nearly infinite. It's like having a second set of hands.

I'm agnostic as to whether I purchase these items individually, or all at once in a prepackaged kit. I just want whatever is cheapest.

I recently learned how to use Selenium Webdriver to drive my web browser, and thought that this would be a great project to test out my automation skills on. It's pretty rote, and repetitive, and I had a hunch that Python could handle it much better/quicker than I could! 

*** Functionality ***
The program first finds the exchange rate from USD to TRY, then finds prices for my pre-selected options: one lighitng kit with a boom arm, one lighting kit without one, and one stand-alone boom arm. The prices for these are all in Turkish Lira. My program converts the prices to USD, and prints the price for each item in both currencies. Then, the program tells me which is the more financially literate option; should I purchase as a kit or purchase individually? Now I don't have to think about it.
