This project was inspired by Angela Yu's "Internet Complaint Twitter Bot" project from 100 Days of Code. 

I'm living in Istanbul (now, at the time I'm taking the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy). 
I'm staying with my girlfriend's parents, and using their wifi, so I don't have access to their contract to know what the "promised" internet speeds are.
Rather than root around in their financial-adjacent personal business, I instead decided to take a different route, and come up with a similar project to do on my own.
I came up with a "disgruntledybg" Twitter bot (ybg acronym short for "yabanci", meaning "foreigner" in turkish).
This bot checks the daily call to prayer (adhan) times, and then checks the current time. 
If the current time matches the time of any of the calls to prayer, the bot tweets out a passive agressive, "They're singing again..." Tweet.
I wanted to Tweet the decibels of the prayer from my current location, as it's often quite loud and distracting, but I lack the necessary microphone hardware to accomplish this without hijacking my iPhone or Macbook-- a route with enough downsides to make this endeavor not worth it.
So, I've settled on grumpily Tweeting "They're singing again..." each time an adhan starts. And just in time for bayram! How culturally sensitive of me :)

As a (tragically) necessary disclaimer, this is not intended to be Islamophobic, I mean for this project to be a lighthearted goof!

Give ol' @disgruntledint2 a follow why dontcha!
